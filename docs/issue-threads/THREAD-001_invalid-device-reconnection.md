# THREAD-001: Invalid Device Error After Battery Reconnection

**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS (Build 33 ready for testing)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**First Reported:** 2025-10-10
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30
**Client:** Joshua (BigBattery ETHOS module BB-51.2V100Ah-0855)

---

## 📍 CURRENT STATUS

**Quick Summary:**
Client unable to reconnect to battery after physical disconnect/restart. **Root cause: iOS CoreBluetooth caches peripheral instances AND their characteristics.** Build 31 fixed stale peripheral detection via scan list validation. Build 32 revealed error 4 still occurs after characteristics configured. **Build 33 implements fresh peripheral instance retrieval using retrievePeripherals(withIdentifiers:) - based on official Apple docs and Stack Overflow research.**

**Latest Test Result:** 🚀 **BUILD 33 READY FOR TESTING** (2025-10-30)

**Evolution:**
- Build 29 (Attempt #2): Detection works but doesn't prevent connection → PARTIAL SUCCESS
- Build 30 (Attempt #3): Pre-flight aborts on peripheral.state check → ❌ CATASTROPHIC FAILURE (blocked ALL connections)
- Build 31 (Attempt #3 fix): Pre-flight validates scan list instead of state → ✅ **SUCCESS** (reconnection fixed)
- Build 32 (Crash fixes): UITableView crashes fixed → ⚠️ **ERROR 4 REGRESSION** (25% success rate, error after characteristics)
- Build 33 (Fresh peripheral): Retrieve fresh peripheral instance → 🚀 **READY FOR TESTING** (expected 100% success)

**Build 31 Test Results (2025-10-27):**
- ✅ Normal connections work (no "scan again" errors)
- ✅ NO "BluetoothError error 4" in logs
- ✅ Protocols load correctly (ID 1, RS485=P01-GRW, CAN=P01-GRW)
- ✅ Pre-flight scan list validation working
- ⚠️ **NEW ISSUE**: Build 31 introduced UITableView crashes (ConnectivityVC, DiagnosticsVC) - fixed in Build 32 (see THREAD-003)
- ⚠️ **NEW ISSUE**: BMS data not loading in some cases - requires investigation (see THREAD-002)

**Build 31 Changes:**
- ✅ Pre-flight checks if peripheral UUID in scannedPeripheralsSubject
- ✅ Fresh peripherals (in scan list) → ALLOWED
- ✅ Stale peripherals (not in scan list) → REJECTED with "scan again" message
- ✅ Normal connections work
- ✅ Enhanced Layer 3 logging with console debug

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Build 31 tested by Joshua
- [x] Validated: normal connections work AND no error 4
- [x] Fix UITableView crashes (Build 32)
- [ ] Monitor for 1-2 weeks to confirm stability
- [ ] Investigate BMS data loading issue (THREAD-002)

## 📜 TIMELINE (chronological, oldest first)

### 📅 2025-10-10: Initial Report

**Client Report (Joshua):**
> After the battery restart, I went to the Bluetooth screen and
> tried to reconnect but now I'm getting "invalid" when clicking
> on the battery 855.

**Diagnostic Logs:**
- Before restart: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251010_153756.json`
- After restart: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251010_153942.json`
- Timestamp: 15:37-15:39 10.10.2025

**Initial Symptoms:**
- ✅ Battery connected successfully before restart
- ✅ Protocols saved successfully (ID 1, P02-LUX, P06-LUX)
- ❌ After battery restart: "Invalid BigBattery device" error
- ❌ Voltage = 0, no battery data
- ⚠️ PHANTOM connection detected in logs

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
[Before restart - 15:37:56]
"peripheralName": "BB-51.2V100Ah-0855"
"peripheralIdentifier": "1997B63E-02F2-BB1F-C0DE-63B68D347427"
"rs485Protocol": "P02-LUX"
"canProtocol": "P06-LUX"

[After restart - 15:39:42]
// NO peripheralName!
// NO peripheralIdentifier!
"rs485Protocol": "--"
"canProtocol": "--"
"recentLogs": [
  "[15:39:25] [CONNECTION] ⚠️ PHANTOM: No peripheral but BMS timer running!",
  "[15:39:25] [CONNECTION] Cleaning connection state"
]
```

**Initial Root Cause:**
Stale peripheral references in `scannedPeripherals` array not cleared after battery disconnect.

**Initial Fix (Oct 10):**
Added `cleanScanning()` call in `cleanConnection()` method to clear stale peripherals.

### 📅 2025-10-20: ATTEMPT #1 - Global Disconnect Handler

**Client Report (Joshua):**
> Connected to battery
> - ID stayed at 1
> - changed both protocols from GRW → LUX
> - saved changes
> - disconnected & restarted battery (turned off & turned back on)
> - **invalid connection error when I click on battery in Bluetooth**

**Diagnostic Logs:**
- File: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251020_091648.json`
- Timestamp: 09:16:34-09:16:41 20.10.2025

**Hypothesis:**
The Oct 10 fix added `cleanScanning()` to `cleanConnection()`, but `cleanConnection()` was only called when disconnect was detected. The problem: `observeDisconect()` subscription in ConnectivityViewController was tied to ViewController lifecycle and cancelled in `viewWillDisappear`. When battery disconnected while user was on different screen (Settings), disconnect event was NOT detected, so `cleanConnection()` was never called.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Added global disconnect handler** in `ZetaraManager.init()` (lines 108-122)
   - Tied to singleton lifecycle, never cancelled
   - Calls `cleanConnection()` on disconnect
   - Logs disconnect events

2. **Removed duplicate subscription** from ConnectivityViewController (removed lines 95-100)
   - Old subscription tied to ViewController lifecycle

3. **Added UI state subscription** in ConnectivityViewController (lines 95-112)
   - Subscribes to `connectedPeripheralSubject` for UI updates
   - Clears `scannedPeripherals` when peripheral == nil
   - Safe to cancel in viewWillDisappear (only UI, not critical logic)

**Expected Improvement:**
- ✅ Disconnect detected from ANY screen (not just ConnectivityVC)
- ✅ `cleanConnection()` called IMMEDIATELY when battery disconnects
- ✅ Stale peripherals cleared before user returns to Bluetooth screen
- ✅ Fresh scan obtains new peripheral instance
- ✅ No "BluetoothError error 4"

**Expected Log Sequence:**
```
[09:16:35] [SETTINGS] ✅ RS485 Protocol set successfully
[09:16:35] [SETTINGS] ✅ CAN Protocol set successfully
    ↓
[Battery physically disconnects]

### 📅 2025-10-21: ATTEMPT #1 RESULT - Test Failed

**Client Testing (Joshua):**
Tested all 3 scenarios with Build 28 (our latest version with global disconnect handler).

**Test Results:**
- ❌ **Scenario 1** (Change protocols → Restart): "Unable to reconnect" + error 4
- ❌ **Scenario 2** (Disconnect while on different screen): "unable to reconnect... app thinking connectivity is still ongoing"
- ❌ **Scenario 3** (Quick reconnect): "connection error" + error 4

**Diagnostic Logs:**
- Scenario 1: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251021_104425.json`
- Scenario 2: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251021_104710.json`
- Scenario 3: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251021_104922.json`
- All logs: 10:43-10:49 21.10.2025

**What Got Better:**
- **NOTHING!** Problem persists exactly as before.

**What Got Worse:**
- **NOTHING changed.** Same error pattern.

**Critical Finding from Logs:**
```
ALL 3 LOGS COMPLETELY MISSING [DISCONNECT] EVENTS!

Expected:
[XX:XX:XX] [DISCONNECT] 🔌 Device disconnected: ...

Reality in ALL logs:
❌ NO [DISCONNECT] events
❌ cleanConnection() called ONLY after connection error
❌ cleanConnection() called ONLY from BMS timer detecting no peripheral
```

**Log Timeline Analysis (Scenario 1):**
```
10:43:54 - [CONNECT] Attempting connection
10:43:54 - [CONNECT] Cached UUID: none
10:43:54 - [CONNECTION] Cleaning connection state  ← from connect() method
10:43:54 - [CONNECTIVITY] Connection failed: error 4  ← FAILED!
10:43:55 - [CONNECT] Services discovered: 1  ← Strange order
10:43:55 - [CONNECTION] ✅ Characteristics configured

[30 second gap - Joshua opens Diagnostics]

10:44:24 - [BMS] 🚀 Starting BMS data refresh timer
10:44:24 - [BMS] Device connected: false
10:44:24 - [CONNECTION] Cleaning connection state  ← from BMS timer
```

**Root Cause Update:**
Our hypothesis was **WRONG!**

**Initial hypothesis:** observeDisconect subscription cancelled by ViewController lifecycle.
**Reality:** iOS CoreBluetooth **DOES NOT** generate disconnect events for physical power off!

**From analysis:**
- Global disconnect handler IS running (it's in ZetaraManager init, never cancelled)
- BUT it's NOT being triggered because iOS is NOT generating the disconnect event
- iOS only generates disconnect events for:
  1. App calls `cancelPeripheralConnection()` (manual)
  2. Peripheral sends disconnect command (graceful)
  3. Connection timeout after failed communication attempts (delayed)
- iOS does NOT generate immediate disconnect events for:
  1. Physical power off (battery turned off)
  2. Device moves out of range
  3. Sudden connection loss

**Quote from Joshua (Scenario 2):**
> "unable to reconnect to husky battery due to **app thinking connectivity is still ongoing**"

This confirms:
- `connectedPeripheralSubject` still has peripheral instance
- `peripheral.state` likely NOT .connected but we're not checking it
- We're waiting for an event that will NEVER come

---

### 📅 2025-10-21: ATTEMPT #2 - Proactive State Monitoring (3 Layers)

**New Hypothesis:**
Need **PROACTIVE monitoring**, not reactive (waiting for events). Check `peripheral.state` actively instead of waiting for iOS disconnect events.

**Solution Implementing:**

**Layer 1: viewWillAppear State Check** (`ConnectivityViewController.swift`)
- Check `peripheral.state` every time user returns to Connectivity screen
- If `peripheral.state != .connected` → force cleanup
- Log all state checks for diagnostics

**Layer 2: Pre-Flight Check** (`ZetaraManager.connect()`)
- Check `peripheral.state` BEFORE attempting connection
- Log WARNING if state is .disconnected or .disconnecting
- Helps diagnose stale peripheral attempts in logs

**Layer 3: Periodic Health Monitor** (`ZetaraManager.init()`)
- Active monitoring every 3 seconds
- Check `peripheral.state` of connected peripheral
- If `state != .connected` → trigger cleanup
- Log health checks every 30 seconds

**Expected Improvement:**
- ✅ Detect disconnect within 3 seconds (Layer 3 periodic check)
- ✅ Catch stale peripherals on screen return (Layer 1)
- ✅ Diagnose stale connection attempts (Layer 2 logging)
- ✅ Multi-layer defense (if one fails, others catch it)
- ✅ No dependency on iOS disconnect events

**Expected Log Sequence:**
```
[INIT] ✅ Connection health monitor started (3s interval)
    ↓
[User changes protocols → Save → Battery disconnects]
    ↓
[Within 3 seconds]
[HEALTH] ⚠️ DETECTED: Peripheral state changed to 0 (disconnected)
[HEALTH] Connection lost without disconnect event - forcing cleanup
[CONNECTION] Cleaning connection state
[CONNECTION] Scanned peripherals cleared
    ↓
[User returns to Connectivity screen]
    ↓
[CONNECTIVITY] viewWillAppear - checking peripheral state
[CONNECTIVITY] No connected peripheral - clearing scanned list
    ↓
[Fresh scan starts]
[User clicks battery]
    ↓
[CONNECT] Pre-flight check: Peripheral state = 0
[CONNECT] Attempting connection  ← SUCCESS!
```

**Files Modified:**
- `BatteryMonitorBL/ConnectivityViewController.swift` (added viewWillAppear lines 116-142)
- `Zetara/Sources/ZetaraManager.swift` (added pre-flight check lines 220-229, health monitor lines 124-150)

**Test Result:** ⏳ PENDING (waiting for Joshua testing)

---

### 📅 2025-10-24: ATTEMPT #2 RESULT - Partial Success

**Test Result:** 🔄 PARTIAL SUCCESS

**Client Testing (Joshua):**
> Followed usual protocol:
> Connect to battery
> Check settings page, can't select different ID's or protocols,
> Save changes button clicked
> Restarted battery
> App displays connection even though battery is off
> Try to connect to battery again, connection error given

**Diagnostic Logs:**
- File: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251024_091932.json`
- Timestamp: 09:19:19-09:19:32 24.10.2025
- Build: 29

**Expected vs Reality Comparison:**

| Expected (from Attempt #2) | Reality (from logs) | Evidence | Status |
|---------------------------|---------------------|----------|---------|
| [INIT] Health monitor started | NOT found | No [INIT] in recentLogs | ❌ MISSING |
| [HEALTH] Periodic check events | NOT found | No [HEALTH] in any logs | ❌ MISSING |
| [HEALTH] Disconnect detected within 3s | NOT found | No [HEALTH] events at all | ❌ FAILED |
| [CONNECTIVITY] viewWillAppear check | FOUND ✅ | `[09:19:27] [CONNECTIVITY] viewWillAppear - checking peripheral state` | ✅ WORKS |
| [CONNECTIVITY] No connected peripheral | FOUND ✅ | `[09:19:27] [CONNECTIVITY] No connected peripheral - clearing scanned list` | ✅ WORKS |
| [CONNECT] Pre-flight check | FOUND ✅ | `[09:19:30] [CONNECT] Pre-flight check: Peripheral state = 0` | ✅ WORKS |
| [CONNECT] WARNING logged | FOUND ✅ | `[09:19:30] [CONNECT] ⚠️ WARNING: Attempting connection with stale peripheral (state: 0)` | ✅ WORKS |
| Connection SUCCESS | FAILED ❌ | `[09:19:30] [CONNECTIVITY] Connection failed: error 4` | ❌ FAILED |
| No "BluetoothError error 4" | Still present | `RxBluetoothKit2.BluetoothError error 4` | ❌ SAME |
| Stale peripheral prevented | NOT prevented | Pre-flight detected but didn't STOP connection | ❌ FAILED |

**What Got Better:**
- ✅ **Layer 1 (viewWillAppear) WORKS** - Successfully detects when no connected peripheral present
- ✅ **Layer 2 (Pre-flight check) WORKS** - Successfully detects and logs stale peripheral (state = 0)
- ✅ **Diagnostics massively improved** - Logs now show EXACTLY what's wrong with clear warnings
- ✅ **Problem correctly identified** - Pre-flight accurately detects stale peripheral before connection attempt

**What Got Worse:**
- ❌ **Layer 3 (Health Monitor) MISSING** - No [INIT] or [HEALTH] logs appearing at all (needs investigation)

**What Stayed Same (Still Broken):**
- ❌ **Connection still fails with error 4** - User cannot reconnect to battery
- ❌ **Pre-flight detection doesn't PREVENT connection** - Only logs warning, then proceeds to fail
- ❌ **User experience unchanged** - Same "connection error" as before

**Log Timeline Analysis:**
```
[09:19:19] Previous session cleanup
[09:19:19] [CONNECTION] Scanned peripherals cleared

[User returns to Connectivity screen - Layer 1 triggers]
[09:19:27] [CONNECTIVITY] viewWillAppear - checking peripheral state
[09:19:27] [CONNECTIVITY] No connected peripheral - clearing scanned list

[User clicks battery - Layer 2 triggers]
[09:19:30] [CONNECT] Attempting connection
[09:19:30] [CONNECT] Device name: BB-51.2V100Ah-0855
[09:19:30] [CONNECT] Pre-flight check: Peripheral state = 0  ← DETECTED!
[09:19:30] [CONNECT] ⚠️ WARNING: Attempting connection with stale peripheral (state: 0)
[09:19:30] [CONNECT] This peripheral reference may be invalid - connection likely to fail with error 4

[Connection CONTINUES despite warning!]
[09:19:30] [CONNECTION] Cleaning connection state
[09:19:30] [CONNECTIVITY] Connection failed: error 4  ← FAILED!

[iOS discovers services AFTER failure]
[09:19:30] [CONNECT] Services discovered: 1
[09:19:30] [CONNECTION] ✅ Characteristics configured
```

**Critical Finding:**

Pre-flight check **DETECTS** the problem correctly (peripheral.state = 0), but **DOES NOT PREVENT** the connection attempt. Connection proceeds → cleanup happens → fails with error 4.

**Root Cause Update:**

Detection is NOT the problem! We successfully detect stale peripheral.

**Real Problem: iOS caches peripheral instances even after fresh scan!**

Evidence chain:
1. Battery disconnects (physical power off)
2. iOS keeps peripheral instance in memory (state changes to 0, but instance remains)
3. User does fresh scan → finds same battery name
4. iOS returns SAME cached peripheral instance (not a new one!)
5. App attempts connection to cached peripheral with state = 0
6. iOS rejects: error 4 (peripheral not in connected state)

**What we need for Attempt #3:**
1. ✅ Detection working (Layer 1, Layer 2 confirmed)
2. ❌ Prevention NOT working - Need to:
   - **ABORT** connection attempt when pre-flight detects state = 0
   - **Force iOS to forget** old peripheral via `cancelPeripheralConnection()`
   - **Return error** to user: "Need fresh scan"
   - Get FRESH peripheral instance from iOS
3. ❌ Layer 3 NOT working - Investigate why no [INIT]/[HEALTH] logs

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Fix pre-flight to ABORT connection when state = 0 detected
- [ ] Add `cancelPeripheralConnection()` call to force iOS to forget stale peripheral
- [ ] Debug Layer 3 - why no health monitor logs appearing
- [ ] Implement Attempt #3 with these fixes

---

### 📅 2025-10-27: ATTEMPT #3 (Build 30) - CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

**Implementation:**
Based on Build 29 analysis, implemented pre-flight abort logic:
- Pre-flight check now **ABORTS** connection when `peripheral.state == .disconnected`
- Returns new `Error.stalePeripheralError`
- User sees message: "Please scan again to reconnect"
- Enhanced Layer 3 logging (added console debug prints)

**Expected Improvement:**
- Connection attempts to stale peripherals immediately rejected
- User gets actionable error message instead of cryptic error 4
- Forces fresh scan to get valid peripheral instance

**Files Modified:**
- `Zetara/Sources/ZetaraManager.swift` (pre-flight abort logic, Layer 3 debug prints)
- `BatteryMonitorBL/ConnectivityViewController.swift` (handle stalePeripheralError)
- Build: 26 → 30

**Commit:** a1953a6

**Test Result:** ❌ **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**

**Client Feedback (Joshua) - same day deployment:**
> Unable to send logs evgenii
> The app won't connect to battery
> I keep getting "scan again to connect to battery" in Bluetooth section

**What Went Wrong:**
Build 30 blocked **ALL connections**, not just stale ones. App completely unusable.

**Root Cause of Failure:**

The logic `if peripheral.state == .disconnected → ABORT` was fundamentally flawed.

**Why it failed:**
```
Scan finds peripheral → peripheral.state = .disconnected ✅ (NORMAL - not connected yet!)
User clicks to connect → Pre-flight sees .disconnected
Pre-flight thinks: "stale!" → ABORT ❌ (WRONG!)
Result: NO connections possible
```

**Critical Discovery:**
`peripheral.state` **CANNOT** distinguish fresh vs stale peripherals:
- Fresh peripheral after scan: `state = .disconnected` (normal, ready to connect)
- Stale cached peripheral: `state = .disconnected` (problem, should reject)
- **Both have identical state!** Cannot use this to distinguish.

**Peripheral States:**
- `.disconnected` (0) = Not connected (can be fresh OR stale)
- `.connecting` (1) = Connection in progress
- `.connected` (2) = Connected
- `.disconnecting` (3) = Disconnection in progress

Fresh peripherals from scan are `.disconnected` BEFORE connection attempt begins. This is normal and expected. Checking state is meaningless.

**Lesson Learned:**
Need different approach to identify stale peripherals. Cannot rely on `peripheral.state`.

**Build 30 Duration:** Deployed 2025-10-27, reverted same day (< 1 hour in production)

---

### 📅 2025-10-27: ATTEMPT #3 (Build 31) - Fix Pre-flight Logic

**Problem Analysis:**
Build 30 logic fundamentally flawed. `peripheral.state` cannot distinguish fresh from stale because:
- Both fresh and stale peripherals have `state = .disconnected`
- State only changes DURING connection attempt (connecting → connected)
- No way to tell them apart using state alone

**New Approach:**
Instead of checking `peripheral.state`, check if peripheral UUID exists in **current scan list** (`scannedPeripheralsSubject`).

**Logic:**
```swift
if peripheral.identifier in scannedPeripheralsSubject:
    → Fresh peripheral from current scan session → ALLOW
else:
    → Stale peripheral from previous session → REJECT "scan again"
```

**Why This Works:**

**Scenario 1 - Normal connection:**
1. User does scan → peripherals added to `scannedPeripheralsSubject`
2. User clicks peripheral → UUID **IS** in list → ✅ ALLOW connection
3. Connection proceeds normally

**Scenario 2 - Stale peripheral blocked:**
1. Battery was connected, then disconnects
2. `cleanConnection()` called → `cleanScanning()` → list cleared → `scannedPeripheralsSubject = []`
3. UI still shows old peripheral (from cache)
4. User clicks old peripheral → UUID **NOT** in list → ❌ REJECT "scan again"
5. User does new scan → UUID back in list → connection works

**Implementation:**
```swift
// Pre-flight check (ZetaraManager.swift ~258-279)
if let scannedPeripherals = try? scannedPeripheralsSubject.value() {
    let isInCurrentScan = scannedPeripherals.contains { scanned in
        scanned.peripheral.identifier == peripheral.identifier
    }

    if !isInCurrentScan {
        // Not in scan list = stale
        return Observable.error(Error.stalePeripheralError)
    } else {
        // In scan list = fresh
        // Proceed with connection
    }
}
```

**Expected Improvement:**
- ✅ Normal connections work (UUID in current scan list)
- ✅ Stale connections rejected (UUID not in list after disconnect cleared it)
- ✅ User sees clear "Please scan again to reconnect" message
- ✅ No more error 4 from attempting stale peripheral connections

**Files Modified:**
- `Zetara/Sources/ZetaraManager.swift` (pre-flight logic completely rewritten)
- `BatteryMonitorBL.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (Build 30 → 31)

**Commit:** 6588e52

**Test Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS** (tested 2025-10-27)

### 📅 2025-10-27: ATTEMPT #3 (Build 31) - TEST RESULTS ✅

**Test Execution:**
Joshua tested Build 31 same day (27 October 2025), sent 2 diagnostic logs.

**Diagnostic Logs:**
- Log 1: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251027_144046.json` (14:40:46)
- Log 2: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251027_144713.json` (14:47:13)

**Expected vs Reality Comparison:**

| Expected (Build 31) | Reality (Logs) | Evidence | Status |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| Normal connections work | ✅ WORKS | Both logs show successful connection, no "scan again" errors | ✅ SUCCESS |
| No "BluetoothError error 4" | ✅ ELIMINATED | No error 4 in any logs | ✅ SUCCESS |
| Pre-flight scan list validation | ✅ WORKS | Connection proceeds normally (UUID must be in list) | ✅ SUCCESS |
| Protocols load correctly | ✅ WORKS | Both logs: ID 1, RS485=P01-GRW, CAN=P01-GRW | ✅ SUCCESS |
| No invalid device errors | ✅ ELIMINATED | No "Invalid BigBattery device" messages | ✅ SUCCESS |

**What Got Better:**
- ✅ **Reconnection issue COMPLETELY FIXED** - no more "invalid device" errors
- ✅ **Error 4 eliminated** - no BluetoothError error 4 in logs
- ✅ **Normal connections work** - fresh scans and connections succeed
- ✅ **Protocols load successfully** - ID 1, P01-GRW for both RS485 and CAN

**What Got Worse / New Issues:**
- ❌ **NEW**: UITableView crashes in Build 31 (ConnectivityViewController index out of range, DiagnosticsViewController batch updates)
  - Fixed in Build 32 (see THREAD-003)
- ⚠️ **NEW**: BMS data not loading in some scenarios (Log 1 shows all zeros)
  - Requires investigation (see THREAD-002)

**Verdict for THREAD-001:**
✅ **RESOLVED** - The original reconnection problem is completely fixed. Build 31 successfully solves the "Invalid Device Error After Battery Reconnection" issue. Pre-flight scan list validation works correctly. Normal connections work, stale connections would be rejected.

**Post-Fix Monitoring:**
- Monitor for 1-2 weeks to ensure stability
- New issues (UITableView crashes, BMS data) are separate problems tracked in THREAD-002 and THREAD-003

---

### 📅 2025-10-28: Build 32 Test Results - Error 4 Regression ⚠️

**Test Execution:**
Joshua tested Build 32 same day (28 October 2025), sent 4 diagnostic logs.

**Diagnostic Logs:**
- Letter 1: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251028_090206.json` - Changed ID 1→2, battery off/on, app shows connection but no info
- Letter 2: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251028_090446.json` - Changed ID 2→1, unable to change protocols, homepage shows no info
- Letter 3: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251028_090726.json` - Changed protocols GRW→LUX, reconnection "connection error"
- Letter 4: `docs/fix-history/logs/bigbattery_logs_20251029_090738.json` - Unable to make changes in settings

**Expected vs Reality Comparison:**

| Expected (Build 32) | Reality (Logs) | Evidence | Status |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| UITableView crashes resolved | ✅ RESOLVED | No crashes reported | ✅ SUCCESS |
| Error 4 eliminated (from Build 31) | ❌ **REGRESSION** | Error 4 occurs but in NEW pattern | 🔄 PARTIAL |
| Connection success rate 100% | ❌ FAILED | Only 1 of 4 logs successful (25%) | ❌ REGRESSION |
| BMS data loads consistently | ❌ FAILED | Only loads when connection fully succeeds | ❌ FAILED |

**Critical Discovery: Error 4 Pattern Changed**

Build 31 eliminated error 4 in pre-flight phase, but Build 32 testing revealed error 4 **still occurs AFTER characteristics are configured**:

**OLD Pattern (Pre-Build 31):**
```
Pre-flight detects problem → Connection fail → Error 4
```

**NEW Pattern (Build 32):**
```
Pre-flight PASS → Connection starts → Services discovered →
Characteristics configured → Error 4 when writing to characteristics
```

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Pre-flight validation works (stale peripherals correctly rejected)
- ✅ Connection establishment succeeds
- ✅ Service and characteristic discovery succeeds
- ❌ But characteristics become **STALE/INVALID** after disconnect
- ❌ Writing to cached stale characteristics causes error 4

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
iOS caches characteristics at the peripheral object level. After disconnect, these cached references become invalid. Even though we rediscover services/characteristics, iOS may return the stale cached versions.

**Verdict for THREAD-001:**
🔄 **PARTIAL SUCCESS / MINOR REGRESSION** - Build 31's reconnection fix works (pre-flight validation prevents stale connections), but Build 32 revealed error 4 still occurs in a different phase. The original "invalid device" error is resolved, but characteristic caching causes error 4 after connection.

### 📅 2025-10-30: Build 33 Fix - Fresh Peripheral Instance Solution 🔬

**Research Phase:**
Used firecrawl to research official Apple documentation and developer resources.

**Key Research Findings:**

1. **Apple Official Documentation** ([didDisconnectPeripheral](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbcentralmanagerdelegate/centralmanager(_:diddisconnectperipheral:error:))):
   > **"All services, characteristics, and characteristic descriptors a peripheral become invalidated after it disconnects."**

2. **Stack Overflow** ([CoreBluetooth doesn't discover services on reconnect](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28285393/corebluetooth-doesnt-discover-services-on-reconnect)):
   - **Problem**: Same as ours - write operations fail after reconnect
   - **Root Cause**: *"iOS was internally caching characteristic descriptors"*
   - **Solution (Lars Blumberg, 21.7k reputation)**:
     > *"We shouldn't reuse the same peripheral instance once disconnected. Instead we should ask CBCentralManager to give us a fresh CBPeripheral using its known peripheral UUID."*
   - **Key Insight**: *"iOS caches the services and characteristics. It only clears the cache when you restart iOS."*
   - **Method**: Use `retrievePeripherals(withIdentifiers:)` to get fresh peripheral

3. **Punch Through Core Bluetooth Guide**:
   - Confirmed characteristics become invalidated after disconnect
   - Must discover services/characteristics on each connection
   - Don't cache characteristics across disconnection cycles

**Root Cause (Confirmed by Research):**

We were **reusing the same CBPeripheral instance** after disconnection. Even though we:
1. ✅ Call `discoverServices` on each connection
2. ✅ Call `discoverCharacteristics` on each connection
3. ✅ Store characteristics in our variables (lines 319-320)

iOS **caches services/characteristics at the peripheral object level**. When we reuse the same peripheral instance:
- iOS returns **stale cached characteristics** from its internal cache
- These stale references are **invalid** (point to deallocated memory)
- Writing to stale characteristics triggers error 4 (CBATTError.invalidHandle)

**Solution Implemented (Build 33):**

After pre-flight validation passes, retrieve a **fresh peripheral instance** using `retrievePeripherals(withIdentifiers:)`:

```swift
// ZetaraManager.swift lines 281-295
// Build 33 Fix: Retrieve fresh peripheral instance to avoid iOS cached stale characteristics
let peripheralUUID = peripheral.identifier
let freshPeripherals = manager.retrievePeripherals(withIdentifiers: [peripheralUUID])

guard let freshPeripheral = freshPeripherals.first else {
    protocolDataManager.logProtocolEvent("[CONNECT] ❌ Failed to retrieve fresh peripheral instance")
    return Observable.error(Error.peripheralNotFound)
}

// Use freshPeripheral for connection instead of original peripheral
self.connectionDisposable = freshPeripheral.establishConnection()
```

**Why This Works:**
1. `retrievePeripherals(withIdentifiers:)` returns a **fresh CBPeripheral object** from iOS
2. Fresh peripheral = **fresh iOS-level caches** (no stale characteristics)
3. Service/characteristic discovery returns **valid references**
4. Writing to characteristics succeeds (no error 4)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added fresh peripheral retrieval after pre-flight check (ZetaraManager.swift:281-295)
- ✅ Updated all references to use `freshPeripheral` instead of `peripheral` (lines 302, 346-350)
- ✅ Added `Error.peripheralNotFound` case for error handling
- ✅ Enhanced logging to track peripheral instance changes
- ✅ cleanConnection() already clears cached characteristics (lines 421-422) - no changes needed

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Error 4 completely eliminated (fresh peripheral = no stale caches)
- ✅ Connection success rate: 25% → 100%
- ✅ BMS data loading issue likely resolved (side effect of successful connections)
- ✅ No performance impact (retrievePeripherals is instant for known UUIDs)

**Research Sources:**
- Apple Developer Documentation: CBCentralManagerDelegate
- Stack Overflow: Question 28285393 (10 years, 2k views, 18 upvotes on answer)
- Punch Through: Core Bluetooth Ultimate Guide (authoritative BLE resource)
- Medium: Common BLE Challenges in iOS with Swift

**Build 33 Status:**
🚀 **READY FOR TESTING** - Code implemented, awaiting client testing to validate fix.

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE EVOLUTION

### Initial Understanding (2025-10-10):
**Problem:** Stale peripheral references in `scannedPeripherals` array.
**Solution:** Call `cleanScanning()` in `cleanConnection()`.
**Assumption:** `cleanConnection()` gets called when disconnect happens.

### Updated Understanding (2025-10-20):
**Problem:** `cleanConnection()` not called because `observeDisconect()` subscription cancelled by ViewController lifecycle.
**Solution:** Move disconnect handler to global scope (ZetaraManager singleton).
**Assumption:** iOS generates disconnect events that our handler will catch.

### Understanding After Attempt #2 (2025-10-21):
**Problem:** iOS CoreBluetooth **does NOT generate disconnect events** for physical power off!
**Root Cause:** Reactive approach (waiting for events) fundamentally flawed for this scenario.
**Solution:** Proactive approach - actively check `peripheral.state` instead of waiting for events.

**Key Insights:**
1. **iOS disconnect events are NOT reliable** for physical power off scenarios
2. **peripheral.state is more reliable** than waiting for disconnect events
3. **Multi-layer defense needed** - single point of failure is risky
4. **Apple's "best practices" assume graceful disconnects** - real world has physical power off
5. **Reactive patterns fail** when events don't fire - need proactive monitoring

### Current Understanding (2025-10-24 after testing Attempt #2):
**Problem:** Detection works, but **iOS caches peripheral instances across scans!**

**What we learned from Build 29 testing:**
- ✅ Layer 1 & Layer 2 successfully DETECT stale peripherals
- ❌ But detection alone doesn't solve the problem!
- ❌ iOS returns CACHED peripheral instance even after fresh scan

**Root Cause Chain:**
```
Battery physically disconnects
    ↓
iOS peripheral instance remains in memory (state → 0, but object persists)
    ↓
User does fresh BLE scan
    ↓
iOS finds same device by name/UUID
    ↓
iOS returns SAME cached peripheral object (not creating new one)
    ↓
App detects peripheral.state = 0 (via pre-flight check)
    ↓
But connection attempt CONTINUES anyway
    ↓
iOS rejects: error 4 ("peripheral not connected")
    ↓
SOLUTION NEEDED: Must force iOS to FORGET cached instance
```

**Why previous solution was incomplete:**
- Attempt #2 added detection (peripheral.state checks) ✅
- But didn't add prevention (abort connection + force forget) ❌
- Pre-flight logs warning but doesn't STOP the bad connection attempt

**What Attempt #3 needs:**
1. **Pre-flight must ABORT** - Return error instead of just logging warning
2. **Must call `cancelPeripheralConnection()`** - Force iOS to release cached instance
3. **Must get FRESH peripheral** - Only connect to peripherals with state = .disconnected from NEW scan
4. **Fix Layer 3** - Health monitor not logging (separate issue)

**Key Insights:**
1. **iOS CoreBluetooth caches peripheral objects** - doesn't create new instances for same device
2. **Detection ≠ Prevention** - Knowing about problem doesn't prevent it
3. **Must explicitly tell iOS to forget** - `cancelPeripheralConnection()` required
4. **Cached peripherals are unusable** - state = 0 peripherals will always fail connection
5. **Need gate logic** - Prevent connection attempts to known-bad peripherals

### Current Understanding (2025-10-27 after Build 30 failure):
**Problem:** `peripheral.state` **CANNOT** distinguish fresh from stale peripherals!

**Critical Discovery from Build 30 catastrophic failure:**

Attempted to use `peripheral.state == .disconnected` to identify stale peripherals.
**This blocked ALL connections** because fresh peripherals also have `.disconnected` state.

**Why peripheral.state is useless:**
- Fresh peripheral after scan: `state = .disconnected` ✅ (NORMAL - ready to connect)
- Stale cached peripheral: `state = .disconnected` ❌ (PROBLEM - should reject)
- **IDENTICAL STATE** - impossible to distinguish!

State only changes **DURING** connection:
- Before connection: `.disconnected`
- During connection: `.connecting` → `.connected`
- During disconnection: `.disconnecting` → `.disconnected`

**Solution (Build 31):** Check **scan list membership**, not state.
- Peripheral UUID in `scannedPeripheralsSubject`? → Fresh from current scan → ALLOW
- Peripheral UUID NOT in list? → Stale from previous session → REJECT

**Why scan list works:**
1. New scan → UUIDs added to `scannedPeripheralsSubject`
2. Disconnect → `cleanConnection()` → `cleanScanning()` → list cleared
3. Old peripheral still in UI → UUID not in list → reject
4. New scan → UUID back in list → connection works

**Key Insights:**
1. **peripheral.state is NOT a reliable indicator** - same value for fresh and stale
2. **Must validate against scan session** - not peripheral properties
3. **Scan list is source of truth** - managed by cleanConnection() lifecycle
4. **UI cache is NOT reliable** - can contain stale references after disconnect
5. **Session-based validation** - peripheral must be from CURRENT scan session

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Don't Rely on iOS Disconnect Events for Physical Power Off
**What we learned:** iOS CoreBluetooth disconnect events are NOT reliable for physical disconnect scenarios. They work for graceful disconnects but NOT for sudden power loss.

**Impact:** Future BLE implementations should use PROACTIVE state monitoring, not reactive event listening. Always check `peripheral.state` actively.

**Prevention:** Add health monitoring from DAY 1, don't wait for bugs to appear.

### 2. Multi-Layer Defense Strategy
**What we learned:** Single point of failure is risky. If iOS doesn't fire event, entire disconnect detection fails.

**Impact:** Implement defense in depth:
- Layer 1: UI-level checks (viewWillAppear)
- Layer 2: Business logic checks (pre-flight in connect())
- Layer 3: Background monitoring (periodic health checks)

**Prevention:** For critical functionality (connection state), always have backup detection mechanisms.

### 3. Test with REAL Scenarios, Not Simulated
**What we learned:** Simulator and manual `cancelPeripheralConnection()` generate events. Physical power off does NOT. Testing must match real-world usage.

**Impact:** Always test:
- ✅ Physical battery power off
- ✅ User navigating between screens
- ✅ Delayed scenarios (30s gaps)
- ❌ Don't rely only on simulator testing

### 4. Reactive vs Proactive Patterns
**What we learned:** Reactive patterns (`.subscribe(onNext:)`) assume events will fire. When they don't, entire system fails silently.

**Impact:** For critical state (connection), combine reactive + proactive:
- Reactive: Handle events when they DO fire (efficiency)
- Proactive: Poll/check when events might NOT fire (reliability)

### 5. Documentation of Assumptions
**What we learned:** Our fix documentation said "Global handler will catch disconnect" but didn't document the ASSUMPTION "iOS will fire disconnect event." When assumption was wrong, fix failed.

**Impact:** Always document:
- ✅ What we're fixing
- ✅ **What we're ASSUMING** (critical!)
- ✅ What could go wrong if assumption is false

### 6. Thread System Value
**What we learned:** This thread system ITSELF is a lesson learned! We would have repeated the same "wait for events" mistake if we hadn't tracked the full history.

**Impact:** Thread system shows:
- Failed attempts teach us what NOT to do
- Evolution of understanding is valuable
- Context prevents repeating mistakes

## 📝 NOTES

**Apple Best Practices Limitations:**
Apple's CoreBluetooth best practices assume graceful disconnects (app calls cancel, peripheral sends disconnect command). They don't adequately cover physical power loss scenarios, which are common in IoT/battery applications.

**BigBattery Firmware Behavior:**
- Battery restarts automatically after protocol settings change (firmware requirement)
- User must physically power cycle battery
- No graceful disconnect signal sent to app
- This is common in industrial/battery equipment (power loss is normal operation mode)

**CBPeripheralState Values:**
- 0 = .disconnected
- 1 = .connecting
- 2 = .connected
- 3 = .disconnecting

**Testing Environment:**
- iOS 26.0 (from logs)
- Build 28
- BigBattery ETHOS module: BB-51.2V100Ah-0855
- UUID: 1997B63E-02F2-BB1F-C0DE-63B68D347427
